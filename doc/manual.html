  <h2><a id="overview">Overview</a></h2>

  <p>ConcurrentLua is a system that implements a concurrency model for the Lua
  programming language. It is based on the share-nothing asynchronous
  message-passing model that is employed in the Erlang programming
  language.</p>

  <p>ConcurrentLua extends Lua's coroutines with message-passing primitives, in
  order to support concurrent programming. Distributed programming is supported
  transparently with the same message-passing primitives.</p>

  <p>ConcurrentLua is implemented as a collection of Lua modules that can be
  loaded by any Lua program. Most of the code is written in Lua itself, with
  minor parts written in C.</p>

  <h3>Model description</h3>

  <p>One of the core elements of ConcurrentLua is the <em>process</em>. A
  process is a light-weight VM thread, that plays the same role as do processes
  in an operating system; they don't share memory but instead they communicate
  through some kind of interprocess communication. These processes can be
  created and destroyed on demand, and a simple round-robin scheduler passes
  control to them.</p>

  <p>Each process is associated with a <em>mailbox</em>, a message queue for the
  temporary storage of messages that were sent to the process. A process can
  check its mailbox for new messages at any time, and if there are any, they can
  be read in the order of arrival.</p>

  <p>Each process is identified by a unique numeric <em>process identifier</em>,
  or else <em>PID</em>. In addition, aliases or process names can be used
  instead of PIDs, in order to refer to processes. These aliases and their
  references are stored in a central repository, the <em>registry</em>.
  Processes can edit the registry, by adding or deleting entries.</p>

  <p>Error handling mechanisms are also provided in the form of
  <em>monitors</em> and <em>links</em>. With monitors processes can monitor the
  other processes, and get notified if the monitored processes terminate
  abnormally. With links processes are bound together, and when one of them
  terminates abnormally the other one is signalled and terminates, too.</p>

  <p>This system also supports distributed programming and all the properties
  that have been described map naturally onto a distributed system. Distributed
  processes communicate with the same primitives as local processes.</p>

  <p>Distribution is based on a component that is called the <em>node</em>. A
  node represents a system runtime inside of which processes are executing.
  Nodes can be connected to each other and communicate, thus forming a
  <em>virtual network</em>. Distributed processes use this network in order to
  exchange messages.</p>

  <p>Each node has a name associated with it. In order for other nodes to
  connect to each other by using only this name, a <em>port mapper daemon</em>
  acts a nameserver. The port mapper daemon has details about the nodes running
  under the network host that the daemon itself is bound to.</p>

  <p>As processes can be created locally, it is also possible to request the
  creation of processes on remote nodes. A remote process can then be handled as
  if it was a local process.</p>

  <p>If the nodes that form the virtual network are fully connected (every node
  is connected bidirectionally to each other), global aliases can be used for
  the processes. The nodes negotiate and maintain a <em>virtual global
  registry</em> and also keep updated local copies of the registry.</p>

  <p>Monitors and links for distributed processes are supported with the same
  semantics as for local processes. Nodes take care of the task of transparently
  handling errors between distributed processes. In addition, it is possible for
  processes to monitor nodes as a whole.</p>

  <p>Nodes are required to authenticate before they can communicate. An
  authenticated node can then be part of the virtual network that the nodes
  form. A simple security mechanism takes care of this task.</p>

  <h3>Implementation details</h3>

  <p>The implementation of ConcurrentLua is based on the Lua component system.
  The system is organized as a collection of Lua modules and submodules. The
  main modules are two, and provide the concurrent and distributed programming
  functionality respectively. One could load only the concurrency module and
  also for each module there is the option of not loading some of the submodules
  if the functionality they provide is not needed. A stand-alone port mapper
  daemon utility is also included.</p>

  <p>The processes in the system are implemented with Lua coroutines. A process
  is actually a Lua coroutine that yields control when the process suspends its
  execution and resumes control when the process continues its execution.</p>

  <p>The scheduling of the processes is still based on the cooperative
  multithreading model that Lua uses. Processes voluntarily suspend their
  execution and thus other processes get the chance to run. Nevertheless, the
  suspending and resuming of processes is partly hidden under a higher level
  mechanism; a process suspends its execution when waiting for a message to
  arrive and becomes ready to be resumed when new messages have arrived in its
  mailbox. A simple round-robin scheduler resumes the processes.</p>

  <p>Any type of Lua data, with the exception of memory references, can be sent
  inside messages. Messages can be booleans, numbers, strings, tables or
  functions, and any combination of them. Data are automatically serialized on
  sent and deserialized on receive, and everything is passed by value.</p>

  <p>Interprocess communication between nodes, and subsequently between
  distributed processes, is based on an asynchronous socket handler. This
  translates to networking model that uses non-blocking sockets and periodic
  polling. This is the approach that is mostly used today by Lua libraries.
  Non-blocking semantics should be also used for IO such as files, pipes,
  etc.</p>

  <h2><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

  <p>Some examples will provide an introduction to the most essential
  properties of the system, from process creation and message passing to
  distributed programming and error handling.</p>

  <h3>Creating processes</h3>

  <p>Processes are created using the <code>spawn()</code> function. The
  <code>spawn()</code> function takes at least one argument; the function that
  contains the command set that the process will execute. Any additional
  arguments are passed directly as arguments of the function.</p>

  <p>The following example demonstrates the creation of a process. The process
  just prints a message as many times as specified:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent = require 'concurrent'

function hello_world(times)
    for i = 1, times do print('hello world') end
    print('done')
end

concurrent.spawn(hello_world, 3)

concurrent.loop()</pre></div>

  <p>The output would be:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
hello world
hello world
hello world
done</pre></div>

  <p>First the system is loaded:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent = require 'concurrent'</pre></div>

  <p>The function that the process will execute is defined next:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
function hello_world(times)
    for i = 1, times do print('hello world') end
    print('done')
end</pre></div>

  <p>A new process is created:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.spawn(hello_world, 3)</pre></div>

  <p>The system's infinite loop is called last:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.loop()</pre></div>

  <h3>Exchanging messages</h3>

  <p>Processes can exchange messages by using the <code>send()</code> and
  <code>receive()</code> functions. Also, the <code>self()</code> function can
  be used to get the PID of the calling process.</p>

  <p>The following program implements two processes that exchange messages and
  then terminate:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent = require 'concurrent'

function pong()
    while true do
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'finished' then
            break
        elseif msg.body == 'ping' then
            print('pong received ping')
            concurrent.send(msg.from, { body = 'pong' })
        end
    end
    print('pong finished')
end

function ping(n, pid)
    for i = 1, n do
        concurrent.send(pid, { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'ping' })
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'pong' then print('ping received pong') end
    end
    concurrent.send(pid, { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'finished' })
    print('ping finished')
end

pid = concurrent.spawn(pong)
concurrent.spawn(ping, 3, pid)

concurrent.loop()</pre></div>

  <p>The output would be:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong finished
ping finished</pre></div>

  <p>After the <em>pong</em> process is created, the <em>ping</em> process is
  supplied with the PID of the <em>pong</em> process:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
pid = concurrent.spawn(pong)
concurrent.spawn(ping, 3, pid)</pre></div>

  <p>The <em>ping</em> process sends a message:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.send(pid, { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'ping' })</pre></div>

  <p>The <em>pong</em> process waits for a message to arrive and saves it in a
  variable when it does:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
local msg = concurrent.receive()</pre></div>

  <p>The <em>pong</em> process replies:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.send(msg.from, { body = 'pong' })</pre></div>

  <p>The <em>pong</em> process terminates after having received a notification
  from the <em>ping</em> process.</p>

  <h3>Registering process names</h3>

  <p>Instead of using process PIDs for sending messages, process names can also
  be used. The <code>register()</code> function can be used to create an alias
  for a process in the registry:</p>

  <div class="verbatim">
    <pre>
concurrent = require 'concurrent'

function pong()
    while true do
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'finished' then
            break
        elseif msg.body == 'ping' then
            print('pong received ping')
            concurrent.send(msg.from, { body = 'pong' })
        end
    end
    print('pong finished')
end

function ping(n)
    for i = 1, n do
        concurrent.send('pong', { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'ping' })
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'pong' then print('ping received pong') end
    end
    concurrent.send('pong', { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'finished' })
    print('ping finished')
end

pid = concurrent.spawn(pong)
concurrent.register('pong', pid)
concurrent.spawn(ping, 3)

concurrent.loop()</pre></div>

  <p>The only change from the previous example is the destination that the
  <em>ping</em> process sends messages to:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.send('pong', { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'ping' })</pre></div>

  <p>And:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.send('pong', { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'finished' })</pre>
  </div>

  <p>And the <em>pong</em> process now registers its name:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.register('pong', pid)</pre></div>

  <p>Therefore the <em>ping</em> process isn't supplied with the PID of the
  <em>pong</em> process.</p>

  <h3>Distributed message passing</h3>

  <p>Processes in different nodes can still communicate with the same message
  passing primitives. Remote processes are denoted by their PID or alias and the
  node they are executing under. The previous example could be broken into two
  programs, one for each process.</p>

  <p>The code for the <em>pong</em> process:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent = require 'concurrent'

function pong()
    while true do
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'finished' then
            break
        elseif msg.body == 'ping' then
            print('pong received ping')
            concurrent.send(msg.from, { body = 'pong' })
        end
    end
    print('pong finished')
end

concurrent.init('pong@gaia')

pid = concurrent.spawn(pong)

concurrent.register('pong', pid)
concurrent.loop()
concurrent.shutdown()</pre></div>

  <p>And the code for the <em>ping</em> process:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent = require 'concurrent'

function ping(n)
    for i = 1, n do
        concurrent.send({ 'pong', 'pong@gaia' },
                        { from = { concurrent.self(), concurrent.node() },
                          body = 'ping' })
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'pong' then print('ping received pong') end
    end
    concurrent.send({ 'pong', 'pong@gaia' },
                    { from = { concurrent.self(), concurrent.node() },
                      body = 'finished' })
    print('ping finished')
end

concurrent.spawn(ping, 3)

concurrent.init('ping@selene')
concurrent.loop()
concurrent.shutdown()</pre></div>

  <p>The output of the <em>pong</em> process would be:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
pong received ping
pong received ping
pong received ping
pong finished</pre></div>

  <p>And the output of the <em>ping</em> process would be:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
ping received pong
ping received pong
ping received pong
ping finished</pre></div>

  <p>In this example the runtime system is running in distributed mode. In order
  for this to happen, first the port mapper daemon has to be started. This can
  done by typing in a command line shell:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
$ clpmd</pre></div>

  <p>The code that initializes the node that the <em>pong</em> process is
  running on:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.init('pong@gaia')</pre></div>

  <p>And the code for the <em>ping</em> process:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.init('ping@selene')</pre></div>

  <p>The previous two code snippets register to the port mapper daemon, the port
  that each node is listening to. Both nodes unregister their port with:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.shutdown()</pre></div>

  <p>The only other changes in this example are the destination that the
  messages are sent to, along with the introduction of the <code>node()</code>
  function that returns the name of the node that the calling process is running
  on:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.send({ 'pong', 'pong@gaia' },
                { from = { concurrent.self(), concurrent.node() },
                  body = 'ping' })</pre></div>

  <p>And later:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.send({ 'pong', 'pong@gaia' },
                { from = { concurrent.self(), concurrent.node() },
                  body = 'finished' })</pre></div>

  <h3>Handling error</h3>

  <p>One approach to handle errors in processes is the notion of linked
  processes. Two processes are bound together and if one of them terminates
  abnormally the other one terminates, too. The <code>link()</code> function can
  be used to link processes:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent = require 'concurrent'

function ping(n, pid)
    concurrent.link(pid)
    for i = 1, n do
        concurrent.send(pid, { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'ping' })
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'pong' then print('ping received pong') end
    end
    print('ping finished')
    concurrent.exit('finished')
end

function pong()
    while true do
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'ping' then
            print('pong received ping')
            concurrent.send(msg.from, { body = 'pong' })
        end
    end
    print('pong finished')
end

pid = concurrent.spawn(pong)
concurrent.spawn(ping, 3, pid)

concurrent.loop()</pre></div>

  <p>The output would be:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong finished</pre></div>

  <p>The <em>pong</em> process never reaches its last line, because it
  terminates when the <em>ping</em> process exits.</p>

  <p>The code that links the processes is:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.link(pid)</pre></div>

  <p>The <code>exit()</code> function is used to make the calling function quit
  abnormally:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.exit('finished')</pre></div>

  <p>It is also possible to trap the exit signal of the terminating process. In
  this case a special message is received:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent = require 'concurrent'

concurrent.setoption('trapexit', true)

function pong()
    while true do
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.signal == 'EXIT' then
            break
        elseif msg.body == 'ping' then
            print('pong received ping')
            concurrent.send(msg.from, { body = 'pong' })
        end
    end
    print('pong finished')
end

function ping(n, pid)
    concurrent.link(pid)
    for i = 1, n do
        concurrent.send(pid, { from = concurrent.self(), body = 'ping' })
        local msg = concurrent.receive()
        if msg.body == 'pong' then print('ping received pong') end
    end
    print('ping finished')
    concurrent.exit('finished')
end

pid = concurrent.spawn(pong)
concurrent.spawn(ping, 3, pid)

concurrent.loop()</pre></div>

  <p>The output would be:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong received ping
ping received pong
pong finished
ping finished</pre></div>

  <p>There is an option related to process linking that can be set with the
  <code>setoption()</code> function, specifically the <code>trapexit</code>
  option:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
concurrent.setoption('trapexit', true)</pre></div>

  <p>Then the <em>pong</em> process receives a special exit message:</p>

  <div class="verbatim"><pre>
if msg.signal == 'EXIT' then
    break
</pre></div>

  <p>Alternatively, monitors that are based on notification messages, can be
  also used for error handling.</p>
